**BREAST CANCER DETECTION USING SVM"
 An assessment of numerous Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernel functions, which include linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels, are used for the crucial utility of breast cancer detection. Early and correct analysis of breast cancer is of paramount importance because it immediately affects the remedy effects and survival rates of affected persons. SVMs have been demonstrated to be relatively powerful types throughout several domains. In this study, the type overall performance of those SVM kernel with DaskGridSearchcv configurations changed into carefully assessed on a breast cancer dataset, using complete assessment metrics and cross-validation techniques. The number one goal changed into discovering the kernel feature that yields the very best type accuracy for breast cancer detection, at the same time as additionally gaining insights into the respective strengths and weaknesses of every kernel type. The findings from this study have giant implications for improving sturdy and dependable breast cancer analysis structures primarily based totally on optimized SVM classifiers. The effects can manually choose the most suitable kernel feature and facilitate the fine-tuning of SVM hyperparameters to maximize the overall performance of this crucial clinical utility.
